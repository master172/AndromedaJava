The following programs Fibbonaci_sequence and valid_parenthesis must be written in their respective files
change the program to take input from the user and output the desired answer
the submissions must be made before 12:20 after which submissions will not be accepted

**The fibbonachi sequence** thakes a number as a input and generates a string of numbers as the output, for example

The fibbonachi sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term is the sum of its two previous terms, starting with 0 and 1

i.e the sequence goes from 0 , 1, 0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, 2+1 = 3, 3+2 = 5, 5+3 = 8, ...... etc
Input: = 10

Output: = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

you must output the entire sequence and not just the nth finbbonachi number

**Valid parenthesis** requires you to write a program that can check the validity of a string of parenthesis, for example

**"(()){[]()}(){}"** is a valid string of parenthesis since each opening bracket has a reachable closing bracket hence the program should outupt true.

but the example **"{(])}({()}){"** is not an valid string of parenthesis since the "]" has no opening brackets and "{" doesn't have a closing bracket hence the ptogram should output false
